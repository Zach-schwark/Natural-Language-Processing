## Write up planning

#### Methodology:

- instructions on page 1
- used 'Adam' optimizer to train NN
- include NN structure 
- how we initialized the initial weights.
- fine tune parrameters on window size of 1
- change the window size to see the affect on accuracy, loss adn training time with an increased window size
- calculated the correlation between words and how similar different words are to each other
- created a bar graph the similar words
- created a 3d scatter plot to view the spacial relationship between the different words.

#### Results:

- Our Graphs/ Plots
- Our Accuracy ( compare accuracy)
- Very Brief Disccussion/explanation our smaller window size is better based on accuracy and plots.
 
#### Discussion:

- interpretation of results.
- Disccusion on how a smaller window size is better
- Potential reasons why a smaller window size is better:
    - less words to learn / are inputted into the model
    - less words to compare, so can learn the relationship between focal words and context words because theres less words to learn
    - Google other reasons ( potentially )
- We originally thought that a larger context window would be better as there could be more meaning/ context for a focal word, so it would be easier to learn the meaning of that word.
